# Twitch (Cloudbot) Commands

I love Cloudbot until I can get my own Twitch bot working. Here are my
commands. I send them to Twitch just using the chat `!addcommand`
interface from my Bonzai (`z twitch command`) command. For now, I have
to add the aliases myself through Cloudbot GUI, but I have them here to
keep on record and for when I make my own bot.
