job: &job >-
  💰 I work for TEKSystems (!tek) as a full-time Kubernetes cloud native
  infrastructure engineer and software developer (!dev) for
  a well-paying multinational corporation (!dox) supporting thousands of
  high performance machine learning compute nodes.
  
work: *job

dev: &dev >-
  💻 I prefer "software developer" or "coder" over "engineer" (which is
  illegal to call youself in Canada without specific schooling). I've
  written thousands of lines of code a dozen or so different languages
  running on millions of systems including most of the Fortune 100.
  While computer science has its place, my work has always been
  practical.

coder: *dev

tek: >-
  🤝 TEKSystems is one of the largest recruiting tech contract work
  companies. You work for TEK, but TEK equally works for you. Unlike
  other companies, you are their customer and their product. You makes
  20-40% less, but they are financially motivated to have your back,
  keep you happy, and find your next gig. The independence is worth it.

vi: &vi >-
  😎 I use Vim with vi-centricity because I want to be productive
  quickly on *any* UNIX-like (!unix) system and I actually know how to
  use leverage the full power of !UNIX !filters. Most Vim and !NeoVim
  users have no idea with that !filter command even does. The smaller
  your .vimrc, the better UNIX user you are.

vim: *vi

neovim: &neovim >-
  💩 Neovim is shit. Mostly because it has no fucking clue what the UNIX
  philosophy is about or for. Don't ruin yourself by learning it. Learn
  !vi properly. https://github.com/rwxrob/zet/tree/main/20210502133019 

nvim: *neovim

about: &about >-
  🔎 I'm Rob Muhlestein, an !engineer, !coder by !trade and !polyglot,
  !grayhat, !mentor and !FOSS contributor when not working. I live in
  Mooresville, North Carolina, USA in an apartment while my !wife
  completes her !art residency in Charlotte.  I choose not to dox my
  company so I can talk about it without disclaimers.  Yes, people from
  work know and watch the stream sometimes. Please don't dox. (Also
  !email !gh !zet !job !project !boost)

info: *about
dox: *about

foss: &foss >-
  🐧 Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) powers the world these days.
  The device you are using right now likely contains significant work
  from FOSS contributors --- especially !Apple computers, which are
  entirely built on "darwin" !BSD UNIX.

opensource: *foss

conduct: &conduct >-
  😊 My personal code of conduct (which I regularly fail to keep).  My
  main life mantra is "don't get mad, get busy" (because I get mad all
  the fucking time). I guess it is my version of "be the change you want
  to seen in the world".  https://github.com/rwxrob/zet/tree/main/20210502120622

mad: *conduct
sad: *conduct
mean: *conduct

faang: >-
  💩 FAANG is shit. It means nothing. Hell, Microsoft (!ms) isn't even
  included that's how fucking stupid the term is. People who willfully
  use it are morons. Facebook (!fb) doesn't belong, at all. MANGA is cooler,
  but still, look for more than these companies, so many companies are
  BETTER on most every objective level.

mute: &mute >-
  🙊 Mute just means I'm not using my microphone usually because I'm
  focused (!focused) and working on something and speaking breaks the
  flow (!flow). Occasionally, I'll beak the silence (when raided to say
  hello, for example).

voice: *mute

facebook: &facebook >-
  💩 Facebook got famous ranking women's faces against one another
  without their consent. It deliberately promoted illegal use to
  children under 12 ("whales") using their parents credit cards. It
  hires experts in neurological addiction and deliberately incites
  violence for money. It's  popular with hate mongers and manipulators
  (like Putin) to blow up civil society, divide families, and bring us
  to war. If you use it YOU are a part of the problem. I don't.

fb: *facebook

music: &music >-
  🎧 https://www.last.fm/user/rwxrob and !song for music. Want something
  added to the playlist? Just find a link to the song on Spotify and
  post it in chat. Happy to take requests.  I have Yoga, Beach,
  Industrial, Chillhop, Synthwave, CoffeeHouse and Piano Jazz. I don't
  really listen to more than that on stream.

playlist: *music

flow: >-
  🤔 Getting in the !flow is something that got popular with techie Cal
  Newport's completely unscientific (but probably correct) book 'Deep
  Work'. Breaking someone's flow is a cardinal sin at most tech shops.
  Keeping a flow is nearly impossible on Twitch, nearly. Using pomodoro
  helps (!pomo).

pomo: &pomo >-
   🍅 ding dong, time to take a 12 pomo break! ❓ Pomodoro method means
   focusing on something intensely then taking a regular break.  Our
   sessions are 54 minutes long since Twitch gives us free,
   uninterrupted time if we take a 12 minute break. Nobody wants an add
   to interrupt them during their flow, right? (!flow) Read more at
   https://github.com/rwxrob/pomo, or add to your own Bonzai tree (!bonzai)

break: *pomo

bonzai: &bonzai >-
  🌳 Bonzai™ (z) is a command compositor with recursive tab completion
  I made to replace messy shell scripts with a single Go monolith
  command tree binary that I can curl onto any device, anywhere. You
  can make everything from utility libraries to modular, extensible root
  kits with it. If you need help creating your own 'z' just ask. If you
  want to learn Go make sure to catch the Beginner Boost on May 4th
  (!boost).  http://github.com/rwxrob/bonzai

z: *bonzai

boost: &boost >-
  ⚡ The SKILSTAK Beginner Boost™ series is an annual cycle of free,
  live, no-strings-attached tech instruction starting on May the 4th at
  11:11:11 and happening weekly live for five hours every Saturday with
  AMA sessions on Sundays. (There's a countdown timer in on my screen.)
  Follow the git repo to see changes to the outline and materials or do
  to any of the previous year's boosts. https://github.com/rwxrob/boost

song: "{readapi.https://groke.se/twitch/spotify/?db6e44917a20ad6113d8bd93620a748e}"

focus: &focus >-
  🤔🎧 I'm focused right now to stay in the flow (!flow). Best way to
  communicate is send a chat message that I'll maybe eventually read --
  especially if you have a Q at the beginning. Catch me on my break
  (!pomo). I might talk then. Please chat away though, others here might
  be able to answer your questions. Also look up the commands (!cmds).

focused: *focus

search: &search >-
  ❓ I search from the command line using three commands 'duck' (?) or
  'google' (??) or 'bing' (???) which open the results in my highly
  customized lynx (!lynx) browser. This means my command line history
  becomes my search history, which I search using Vim mode ('set -o
  vi').

?: *search
??: *search
???: *search

lynx: &lynx >-
  😼 Lynx (the text-based web browser) in Vi mode is the fastest way to
  do web research, period. I pity graphic web browser users ---
  especailly hackers --- who haven't learned it. Need a graphic browser?
  Just hit comma (,) to open it. There's no tracking and text is
  consistent so your eyes remain focused and able to scan at maximum
  speed. Watch me if you're not convinced. Start with w3m if Lynx is too
  much at first.  https://github.com/rwxrob/lynx
